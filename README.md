### Hi there!

My name is Daniel, I'm currently finishing my studies as a Computer Engineer at the Autonomous University of Madrid (Spain). Here I'll post my public projects in the way of a portfolio.

Although I focus on data science & software development at a professional level, I also enjoy classic low-level programming as a hobby quite a lot.

You can visit <a href="https://danibt656.github.io/website/" target="_blank">my website</a> if you're interested in my contact info and more.

Or you can directly jump to my <a href="https://danibt656.github.io/website/docs/CV.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Curriculum Vitae</i></a> for business matters.
