### Hello, world!

My name is Daniel, I'm currently finishing **my studies as a Computer Engineer** at the Autonomous University of Madrid (Spain). Here I'll post my public projects in the way of a portfolio.

Although **I focus on machine learning & data science** at a professional level, I also enjoy classic low-level programming as a hobby quite a lot.

You can visit **<a href="https://danibt656.github.io/website/" target="_blank">my website</a>** if you're interested in my contact info and more.

Or you can directly jump to ***<a href="https://danibt656.github.io/website/docs/CV.pdf" target="_blank">my Resume</a>*** for business matters.
