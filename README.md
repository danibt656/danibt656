### Hi there!

My name is Daniel, I'm currently finishing my studies as a Computer Engineer at the Autonomous University of Madrid (Spain). Here I'll post my public projects in the way of a portfolio.

You can visit [my website](https://danibt656.github.io/website/) if you're interested in my contact info and more.

Or you can directly jump to my <a href="https://danibt656.github.io/website/docs/CV.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Curriculum Vitae</i></a> for business matters.
